## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

I wanted to create a tracker application for the Sims 4 Legacy Challenge. This is one of most commonly used challenges today in the Sims 4 community, but as of yet there are no trackers fully automated applications for the scoring system. However, there are excel sheets made by the awsome Sims 4 community.

When I play this challenge I get easily overwhelmed by all the data and stuff I have to keep track of and the messy design of an Excel sheet doesn't help.

So therefore I have for the past couple of years been planning and thinking about making a website that handles everything for you and displays the relevant data in a nice responsive fashion.

> This application was began its production during the final weeks of the [Technigo Bootcamp](https://www.technigo.io/).

Thanks to everyone from the Technigo community for supporting me during development and giving me a platform to learn and improve my skills.

Also of course a HUGE and massive thank you to the Sims community who had already created some trackers using Excel and gave me the inspiration to do this!
